# BeeU
The First Repo for the BeeU Project. Please keep in mind that all of the things written in this readMe file are subject to change, a template, a first run.

# Reason for creating BeeU
We encourage everyone and anyone to be themselves. In whatever hobby, hustle, or dream they want to achieve, BeeU can help people track their progress and keep it all in one place.
Share with the world, your friends, or keep it to yourself.
